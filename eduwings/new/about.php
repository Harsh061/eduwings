			<p> EduWings is all about connecting with people, sharing knowledge, experience and thoughts.

          Come and join with us</p>
          <br>
          <h3><b>Our Motive</b></h3>
        <p>As it is well said that <b>"Your Knowledge increases if you share it".</b></br>So, this is just our small initiative to get in touch with you.
          Through this we will also get a chance to learn something new from you and update our knowledge.</p><br>
        <h3><b>Why choose us ? </b></h3>
        <p>We are not as good as our teachers. But when they are not available we can help you out. You can also get reference notes from us. Give us a try.
          The one main difference between personal training and eLearning is that personal training allows learners to personally interact with instructors and other learners in a live environment, whereas learners have to depend on electronic media to interact with the course in eLearning. </p><br>
        <h3><b>How we work?</b></h3>
        <p>We will recieve your request and respond to it within 3-4 hrs via email.So stay connected. We can also teach you through Skype. Anyone of us will be there to help you out asap.</p>
